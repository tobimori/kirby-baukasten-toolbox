# Kirby Spielzeug

Spielzeug is a encapsulated set of helpers & tools I use for my projects and serves as the independent foundation for [Kirby Baukasten](https://github.com/tobimori/kirby-baukasten).

Whenever I need a new general purpose function, method or any addition that can be encapsulated in a plugin, they'll be added in here. No more copy pasting between projects ðŸŽ‰
